# User Table Management

## Overview
This project is a user table management system that includes features like pagination, table sorting, and integration with Shadcn for UI components. Below is a detailed explanation of the key components and how they are integrated into the project structure and workflow.

## Pagination
Pagination is implemented to handle large sets of user data efficiently. It allows users to navigate through data in chunks rather than loading everything at once.

### Implementation
- **Backend**: The server-side code handles the logic for fetching a specific subset of user data based on the current page and page size.
- **Frontend**: The UI provides controls for navigating between pages. The current page and page size are sent as parameters in API requests to fetch the corresponding data.

### Workflow
1. User interacts with pagination controls (e.g., next, previous, page numbers).
2. An API request is made with the current page and page size.
3. The server responds with the appropriate subset of user data.
4. The frontend updates the table to display the new data.

## Shadcn
Shadcn is used for building consistent and reusable UI components across the application.

### Implementation
- **Component Library**: Shadcn components are imported and used to build the user interface, ensuring a consistent look and feel.
- **Customization**: Components can be customized to match the project's design requirements.

### Workflow
1. Identify the UI components needed for the project.
2. Import and use Shadcn components in the relevant parts of the application.
3. Customize components as needed to fit the design specifications.

## Table
The table component is central to the user management system, displaying user data in a structured format.

### Implementation
- **Data Binding**: The table is bound to the user data fetched from the server.
- **Sorting**: Columns can be sorted to allow users to organize data based on different criteria (e.g., name, email).

### Workflow
1. Fetch user data from the server.
2. Bind the data to the table component.
3. Implement sorting functionality for table columns.
4. Update the table whenever new data is fetched or sorting criteria change.
